# hello-world
first educational repository
 My name is Andrii Levchenko. I\`m an engineer in shipbuilding. I\`d like to learn data science and machine learning \`cause it seems very intersting to me. I learn Python as a hobby an use it a little for automation in my engineering routine. Python is a great instrument!
